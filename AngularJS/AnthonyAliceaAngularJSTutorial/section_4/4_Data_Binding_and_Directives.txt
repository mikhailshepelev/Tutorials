Scope and Interpolation:
========================

	Interpolation:
	============

		creating a string by combining string and placeholders.

		'My name is' + name is interpolated, and results is 'My name is Tony'.

How it does work inside angularjs:
==================================

	whatever that is done inside the $scope is avaialbe inside the view


	var app = angular.module('app',[]);

	app.controller('mainController',['$scope','$timeout',function($scope,$timeout){

		$scope.name = 'Narayanan';

		$timeout(function(){
			$scope.name = 'TOmy';
		},3000);

	});

Directives and two way data binding:
===================================


	an instruction to AngularJS to manipulate a piece of the DOM.

	It could be add a class, hide this create this.

	ng-model:
	=========

		bind a particular element to the scope of the variable

		this directive says that this element to be bound to a specific variable in the scope.


		Attach the view to the model.

Watchers and digest loop:
=========================

	JS has event loop.

	AngularJS adds event listener for you and its extending the event loop to auto control the binding between the model and view.

	Adds an Angular Context

	Need to keep track of variables and watchers.

	Part of watching and checking if something has changed.. is the $digest.


	Digest cycle Has something changed?

	If something has changed.. it updates every where the value of it.

	by changing that is something other changed? It checks!

	If changed it updates the DOM.

	Adding out $watch:
	==================

	self.$watch('handle',function(newValue,oldValue){

	})

	this function runs when the handle changes.

	// runs async and not watched by the angular $digest

	setTimeout(function(){
    	self.handle = 'newtwitterhandle';
    	console.log('scope Changed!');
    },3000);


    $scope.$apply() // apply whatever I put in here to the angularJs context

    instead of using setTimeout we use $timeout to tell angular to make it in angular context.

    Part of angularjs context.


    Model,view and *
    =================

    	Watchers and digest loop connects the model and view.


Common Directives:
=================

	ng-if removes/ allows the entire pieces of the DOM based on the JS expression.

	ng-show/ng-hide - adds a display: none ! important in css.

	ng-class - takes a JSON object.

	Add and remove class based on data from model and view.

	ng-repeat - repeat each item in an array.

Common Directives: part 2
=================

	show the interpolation syntax for a second and the JS syntax take over it

	to avoid it AngularJS uses ng-clock.

	ng-clock hides the element in the DOM until AngularJS has worked on it.

XMLHttpRequest:
==============

	XMLHttpRequest is native to the browsers.

	Invented by the Microsoft.

	Can make request via its code.

External data and $http:
=========================

$http.get()
$http.post()
