Problem AngularJS is trying to solve:
====================================

	 If we have 2 UI buttons it is ok to use jQuery.

	 But what if we have 20?!?!

	 Representation of the HTML that sits inside browser's memory.

	 Way for us to Manipulate and read code.

	 More code if we use jQuery.

	 Just update one side and other side updated automatically.

	 Update JS and HTML auto updates.

	 Complexity of managing both the DOM and HTML and logic and variables and data manually.

Model, View and whatever...
==========================

	Connect HTML and data

    MVC:
	====

		Model : in JS let's say, a  variable
		View : what the user sees, the HTML
		binds the model and the view

		Model and View are bound together
		Any changes made to the view affects the model and vice versa.

		Binding is done by controllers, view models and whatever.

		AngularJS is MV*

Custom Attributes:
==================

	* Custom attributes doesn;t affect the webpage visually.
	* Still there in DOM.
	* ng- represents the HTML Attributes.
	* data-ng- for strict HTML5.

Global Namespace:
=================

	Global Namespace 


	var steveApp = {};
	steveApp.person = "Steve";
	steveApp.logPerson = function(){
		console.log(steveApp.person);
	}

	steveApp.person = "Tony";
	steveApp.logPerson();

Modules, Apps and controllers:
===============================


	controller binds the model and the view using the $scope.
